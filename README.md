Platform Scroller Game - Project Documentation
This repository contains the documentation for my A-Level Computer Science NEA project, where I developed a 2D platform scroller game using C# and .NET. Unfortunately, the game files are no longer accessible, but this document outlines the development process, key features, and evaluation of the project.

About the Project
Developed as part of my A-Level NEA coursework
Built using C# and .NET Framework
Implemented key programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, collision detection, and event-driven programming
Designed following the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
Contents
